# Hate-Crime-Tristate-Data
Hate crimes recorded by the FBI across the tristate region from 2020 to 2023

For this project, I will create a data warehouse using the FBI's hate crime dataset. On the CDE website, they stated that the most up-to-date data included records up to 2023.
Preferably, I was also looking forward to working with 2024 data, but based on when data is updated, I would have had to wait until September of this year (2025) to access 2024 records.
Furthermore, the website did not provide me with a data dictionary so I had to make my own.
Regardless, given what I have, I will be giving my first attempt at building a proper data warehouse.
For my storage and data warehouse, I used Google Cloud.

This project has 6 main components which follows:
- Data sourcing
- Defining the business requirements
- Defining the functional requirements
- Creating an information architecture
- Creating a data architecture
- Dimensional modeling

I have uploaded the necessary links and files for you to look over my work.
The uploaded PDF explains my data and where I sourced it from. It also defines both my business and functional requirements as well as displaying my architecture models with brief descriptions for each of them.
I have provided links to my data dictionary and dataset within this document.
I also uploaded my star scheme model as a DBS file with a separate PDF file titled "dimension_model" which lists out the facts and dimensions.
