# Hate-Crime-Tristate-Data
Hate crimes recorded by the FBI across the tristate region from 2021 to 2023

For this project, I will create a data warehouse using the FBI's hate crime dataset. On the CDE website, they stated that the most up-to-date data included records up to 2023.
Preferably, I was also looking forward to working with 2024 data, but based on when data is updated, I would have had to wait until September of this year (2025) to access 2024 records.
Furthermore, the website did not provide me with a data dictionary so I had to make my own.
Regardless, given what I have, I will be giving my first attempt at building a proper data warehouse.

This project has 6 main components which follows:
- Data sourcing
- Defining the business requirements
- Defining the functional requirements
- Creating an information architecture
- Creating a data architecture
- Dimensional modeling

I have uploaded the necessary links and files for you to look over my work.
I have links for my original dataset, the cleaned and transformed dataset, as well as my own data dictionary.
The three documents cover the first four primary components of the project (business and functional requirements as well and a brief description of my data can be found in a single document, while the architectures have their respective files)
Lastly, I have also uploaded a DBS file that models my data warehouse.
